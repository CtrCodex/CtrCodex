## About Me
Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology, and my passion for programming was ignited by watching Iron Man and Batman and seeing how they used technology to solve problems. Even before that, 
I was curious about how things worked, like weather stations and the tech behind them. That curiosity led me to programming, where Iâ€™m now primarily focused on Python.

What excites me the most about being a developer is the problem-solving process and the thrill of creating solutions. Thereâ€™s nothing quite like overcoming a challenge, no matter how long it takes, 
and turning that solution into a project thatâ€™s useful and functional. My goal is to create something Iâ€™m proud ofâ€”something innovative and valuable.

One project Iâ€™ve started is a command line interface tool, and although it's still in progress, 
it's a step toward building something meaningful. Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to expand my skills and take on exciting challengesÂ inÂ development.
